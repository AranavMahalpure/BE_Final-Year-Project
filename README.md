# üß† Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. It leverages the BRATS dataset and utilizes a U-Net architecture to perform pixel-level tumor segmentation. The application also includes tumor severity classification and is deployed via a user-friendly web interface.

## üìå Features

- Brain tumor detection from MRI scans
- Tumor segmentation using U-Net architecture
- Tumor severity classification (e.g., Low-grade, High-grade)
- Web-based user interface for real-time image upload and diagnosis
- Dockerized deployment for easy scalability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask / Django (choose one), React.js
- **Data:** BRATS Dataset (Brain Tumor Segmentation)
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, WSL
- **Deployment:** Localhost or cloud (e.g., Render, Heroku, AWS)

## üß¨ Model Architecture

- **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and convert images to grayscale if needed
- **Model:** U-Net (for segmentation), CNN (for classification)
- **Loss Function:** Dice coefficient + Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, IoU, Dice Score
